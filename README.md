# Face-Mask-detector
Face Mask detector using openCV and Deep learning
In this project opencv is used to open webcam to capture frames on which haar cascade classifier is used for face recognition. Then on each face CNN model is applied which predicts whether mask is present or not.
This information is shown on the frame.
In try.py CNN model is trained which is saved as my_model.
in face_try.py opencv code is there.
